% UVic Thesis Document Class Options
% ==================================
%
% In addition to the options provided by the book document class, the
% uvicthesis document class also supports the following options:
%
% review
%     Enable review mode (e.g., use double spacing).
%     This generally looks ugly but is very helpful if a reviewer
%     (e.g., supervisor) wants to write annotations on the pages
%     of the document in order to indicate corrections/revisions that
%     should be made.

% IMPORTANT NOTE:
% The University of Victoria changed the rules for theses at some point in
% time to require pagination for one-sided printing.  As a result, the
% oneside option must be used.

\documentclass[
  10pt,
  oneside,
  %review, % Uncomment for review mode.  (See above for details.)
