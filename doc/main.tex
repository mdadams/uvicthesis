% UVic Thesis Document Class Options
% ==================================
%
% In addition to the options provided by the book document class, the
% uvicthesis document class also supports the following options:
%
% review
%     Enable review mode (e.g., use double spacing).
%     This generally looks ugly but is very helpful if a reviewer
%     (e.g., supervisor) wants to write annotations on the pages
%     of the document in order to indicate corrections/revisions that
%     should be made.

% IMPORTANT NOTES:
%
% The University of Victoria changed the rules for theses at some point in
% time to require pagination for one-sided printing.  As a result, the
% oneside option must be used.
%
% The University of Victoria should allow (unless the rules have changed
% since the time of this writing) font sizes of 10, 11, or 12 point.
% There are numerous tradeoffs in the choice of font size:
%   - larger fonts often make typesetting more difficult because
%     many tables/figures/equations/listings fall outside the margins of
%     the page
%   - larger fonts are easier for people with poor eyesight to read
%     when viewing a document on a small display
% So, generally, larger fonts have both advantages and disadvantages.
% Personally, I would recommend using a larger font as long as you
% do not encounter problems with tables/equations/figures not fitting
% on the page.

\documentclass[
  %10pt,
  11pt, % NOTE: Perhaps, this is the best compromise for font size?
  %12pt,
  oneside,
  %review, % Uncomment for review mode.  (See above for details.)
